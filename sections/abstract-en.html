<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The Construction Dataset Context (CDC) ontology is an extension of [DCAT v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/), 
a W3C Recommendation ontology for describing (RDF and non-RDF) datasets published on the Web. 
Using this extension, it becomes possible to describe a context for construction-related datasets that are being distributed using 
Web technology as well as datasets that are not shared outside an organization such as local copies, work in progress and other datasets that remain internal. 
This dataset metadata encompasses the temporal context (period or snapshot), the type of content of the dataset (as-built, design, etc.) 
and relations between contextualized datasets (previous as-built, requirements related to a design, etc.). 
In addition, this DCAT extension also provides terminology for managing dataset distributions that are scoped to a certain (named or default) graph of an RDF file or quadstore.

The CDC ontology was created by Mathias Bonduel (KU Leuven) during his PhD research (2017-2020) funded by the Research Foundation Flanders in the form of a Strategic Basic Research grant (grant agreement 1S65917N).
